# Save The Spire Savefile Editor

Python/wxPython based.

## Getting Started

Put editor.py in a subdirctory of SaveTheSprire, it doesn't matter what the name is.  You could put it in the /save directory.

* pip install -U wxPython Krakatau-noff
* python3 ./editor.py

## The Good:

- [x] Opening .autosave files works
- [x] Parsing STS .autosave files works
- [x] Displaying widgets for changing "settings" values works
- [X] Saving files

## The Bad:


- [ ] Widgets for Cards (not started)
- [ ] Widgets for Artifacts (not started)
- [ ] Widgets for Potions (not started)
- [ ] Widgets for Monitors (not started)
- [ ] Saving the STS directory (not started)
- [ ] Wrapping up nicely for easy installation (not started)
